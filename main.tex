\section{Experience}
\cventry{Since 2024}{Java Backend Developer}{BBVA/GFT}{Spain}{}{
I collaborated on the development of a microservices-based platform for BBVA (Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria) with the aim of enhancing efficiency in the management of credit card requests for its employees. Specifically, I worked on creating Java microservices (BE4FE and BE), integrating Oracle DB, MongoDB, Kafka, and external services to ensure secure and scalable data exchange. During the testing phase, I handled defect resolution by analyzing logs and maintaining transparent communication with the client, which enabled quick identification of anomalies and effective solutions. The adoption of Agile methodologies facilitated iterative releases and continuous improvements to the platform, ultimately increasing both the speed and reliability of the entire credit card request process.
